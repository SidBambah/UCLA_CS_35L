Q1. Brady's patch removed the line "case_long_iso_time_style:" because the
	compiler considers it to be a go to label rather than a case of the switch
	statement. It is necessary for this line to be removed as the program will
	not hit the correct case with it still in place.

Q2. If the locale for people in countries that don't speak English is not in the
	locales specified by the modified ls command, the date output will revert
	back to the English version rather than the numerical date output.

Q3. When the script is invoked on an empty file, such as /dev/null, an error is
	displayed. This is because the randline program tries to access all of the
	lines of the document and, if there are no lines, the seq variable is empty
	and the error is presented as follows:
	Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./randline.py", line 70, in <module>
    main()
  File "./randline.py", line 64, in main
    sys.stdout.write(generator.chooseline())
  File "./randline.py", line 34, in chooseline
    return random.choice(self.lines)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/random.py", line 273, in choice
    return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]  # raises IndexError if seq is
	empty
	IndexError: list index out of range

Q4. When running the randline program without any operands, python3 gives an
	error while python does not. This is because the syntax required for python3
	is different from that required for python. The output for the command
	python randline.py is:
	Usage: randline.py [OPTION]... FILE

	Output randomly selected lines from FILE.

	randline.py: error: wrong number of operands
	However, the output for python3 randline.py is:
		File "randline.py", line 65
		except IOError as (errno, strerror):
						  ^
		SyntaxError: invalid syntax
	In order to fix this error, a single parameter could be passed instead of
	the two given parameters.
